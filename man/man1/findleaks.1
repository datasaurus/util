.TH memtrace 1 "Find leaks"
.SH NAME
memtrace \- search for leaks in output from diagnostic allocators
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIprog\fP \fB2>&1 | memtrace\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script scans error output from \fIprog\fP.  \fIprog\fP
should manage memory only with \fBMALLOC\fP (3), \fBCALLOC\fP (3), 
\fBREALLOC\fP (3), and \fBFREE\fP (3), and it should be run with the 
\fBMEM_DEBUG\fP environment variable defined.  When \fIprog\fP
exits, \fBmemtrace\fP prints a list of any allocations that were never
freed.  These are possible memory leaks.
.SH SEE ALSO
