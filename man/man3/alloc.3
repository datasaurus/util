.TH alloc 3 "Allocators with optional diagnostics"
.SH NAME
MALLOC, CALLOC, REALLOC, FREE \- allocators with optional diagnostics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include "alloc.h"\fP
\fBvoid * MALLOC(size_t\fP \fIs\fP\fB);\fP
\fBvoid * CALLOC(size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIs\fP\fB);\fP
\fBvoid * REALLOC(void *\fP \fIp\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIs\fP\fB);\fP
\fBvoid FREE(void *\fP \fIp\fP\fB);\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These macros allocate and free memory using the standard library memory management
functions.  \fBMALLOC\fP, \fBCALLOC\fP, and \fBREALLOC\fP behave like \fBmalloc\fP,
\fBcalloc\fP, and \fBrealloc\fP, respectively, with the exception that they abort
the process if they fail.  \fBFREE\fP behaves exactly \fBfree\fP.
.SH OPTIONAL DIAGNOSTICS
If the \fBMEM_DEBUG\fP environment variable is defined, the macros also
arrange for output of diagnostic information.  The diagnostic output can
help identify memory leaks.

If \fBMEM_DEBUG\fP represents an integer, it is interpreted as a file descriptor.
Thus, in the following example, \fBapp\fP will send diagnostic information to
file descriptor \fB2\fP (standard error).

.nf
.in +5
\fBexport MEM_DEBUG=\fP\fI2\fP
\fBapp\fP
.in -5
.fi

Otherwise, \fBMEM_DEBUG\fP is interpreted as a file name.  Diagnostic output
will go to this file, over-writing any previous contents.
In the following example, \fBapp\fP will send diagnostic information to
file \fBapp.mem.out\fP

.nf
.in +5
\fBexport MEM_DEBUG=app.mem.out\fP
\fBapp\fP
.in -5
.fi

When \fBMALLOC\fP or \fBCALLOC\fP allocates memory with \fBMEM_DEBUG\fP defined,
it prints a line of form:

.nf
.ti +5
\fIaddress\fP \fB(\fP\fIcounter\fP\fB)\fP \fBallocated at\fP \fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP
.fi

If \fBREALLOC\fP returns \fIp\fP, it prints a line of form:

.nf
.ti +5
\fIaddress\fP \fB(\fP\fIcounter\fP\fB)\fP \fBreallocated at\fP \fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP
.fi

If \fBREALLOC\fP returns a new address, it prints two lines of form:

.nf
.in +5
\fIaddress\fP \fB(\fP\fIcounter\fP\fB)\fP \fBfreed by realloc at\fP \fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP
\fIaddress\fP \fB(\fP\fIcounter\fP\fB)\fP \fBallocated by realloc at\fP \fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP
.in -5
.fi

When \fBFREE\fP frees memory, it prints a line of form:

.nf
.ti +5
\fIaddress\fP \fB(\fP\fIcounter\fP\fB)\fP \fBfreed at\fP \fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP
.fi

Above, \fIaddress\fP is the address of the new or modified allocation,
\fIcounter\fP is the number of times one of the allocation macros has been
called, and \fIfile\fP and \fIline\fP identify the C source file and line
number where the call occurred.

The resulting output gives a history of allocations and calls to free made by
the process.  Script \fBmemtrace\fP can scan this output and report on
any allocations made that have not been freed when the process exits.  These
are assumed to be memory leaks, and the diagnostic output can help find where
and when they occurred.
.SH SIMULATING ALLOCATION FAILURES
If environment variable \fBMEM_FAIL\fP exists and has form
\fIfile\fP\fB:\fP\fIline\fP, and line \fIline\fP of source file \fIfile\fP has
a call to \fBMALLOC\fP, \fBCALLOC\fP, or \fBREALLOC\fP, then the allocator will
always return \fBNULL\fR.  This exercises code branches that handle allocation
failures.
