.TH alloc 3 "Allocators with optional diagnostics"
.SH NAME
MALLOC, CALLOC, REALLOC, FREE \- allocators with optional diagnostics
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include\fR \fB"alloc.h"\fR
.br
\fBvoid *\fR \fBMALLOC\fR(\fBsize_t\fR \fIs\fB)\fR;
.br
\fBvoid *\fR \fBCALLOC\fR(\fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIs\fB)\fR;
.br
\fBvoid *\fR \fBREALLOC\fR(\fBvoid *\fR \fIp\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIs\fB)\fR;
.br
\fBvoid\fR \fBFREE\fR(\fBvoid *\fR \fIp\fR)\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
These macros allocate and free memory using the standard library memory management
functions.  \fBMALLOC\fR, \fBCALLOC\fR, and \fBREALLOC\fR behave like \fBmalloc\fR,
\fBcalloc\fR, and \fBrealloc\fR, respectively, with the exception that they abort
the process if they fail.  \fBFREE\fR behaves exactly \fBfree\fR.
.SH OPTIONAL DIAGNOSTICS
If the \fBMEM_DEBUG\fR variable is defined at compile time, such as with a
line of form '\fB#define MEM_DEBUG\fR' in a header file, the macros also
arrange for diagnostic information to go to standard error.  This information
can help identify memory leaks.
.PP
When \fBMALLOC\fR or \fBCALLOC\fR allocates memory, it prints a line of form:
.IP
\fIaddress\fR (\fIcounter\fR) \fBallocated at\fR \fIfile\fR\fB:\fIline\fR
.PP
Here, \fIaddress\fR is the address of the new allocation, \fIcounter\fR is
the number of times one of the allocation macros has been called, and \fIfile\fR
and \fIline\fR identify the C source file and line number where the call occurred.
.PP
If \fBREALLOC\fR returns its argument, it prints a line of form:
.IP
\fIaddress\fR (\fIcounter\fR) \fBreallocated at\fR \fIfile\fR\fB:\fIline\fR
.PP
If \fBREALLOC\fR returns a new address, it prints two lines of form:
.IP
\fIaddress\fR (\fIcounter\fR) \fBfreed by realloc at\fR \fIfile\fB:\fIline\fR
.br
\fIaddress\fR (\fIcounter\fR) \fBallocated by realloc at\fR \fIfile\fB:\fIline\fR
.PP
When \fBFREE\fR frees memory, it prints a line of form:
.IP
\fIaddress\fR (\fIcounter\fR) \fBfreed at\fR \fIfile\fB:\fIline\fR
.PP
The resulting output gives a history of allocations and calls to free made by
the process.  Script \fBmemtrace\fR can scan this output and report on
any allocations made that have not been freed when the process exits.  These
are assumed to be memory leaks, and the diagnostic output can help find where
and when they occurred.
