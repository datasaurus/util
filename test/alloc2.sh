alloc2.sh --

This script tests the allocators defined in src/alloc.c and the findleaks
application.  See alloc (3) and findleaks (1) for more information.

The script creates a test program that allocates and frees memory using
functions in alloc.c.  The test program intentionally fails to free
memory that it allocates.  The failures should be apparent in output from
the program and findleaks.  You must read the output and check for error
messages and inconsistencies.

The script puts source code for the test program into a source file
named alloc2.c and creates an executable named alloc2.  The program
files are normally deleted when the script exits.  To preserve
program and temporary files for post mortem troubleshooting, set
RM in the environment to a command that does not delete anything,
e.g. ':'.

Usage suggestions:
./alloc2.sh 2>&1 | less
env RM=: ./alloc2.sh 2>&1 | less
